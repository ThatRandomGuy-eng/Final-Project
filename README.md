Question :

1. What is climate change?
Answer: long-term changes in temperature and weather patterns.

2. How serious is this problem? Does this concern us?
Answer: Very serious, climate change is an important issue that needs attention 
us because it can impact the lives of all of us.

3. What triggers climate change?
Answer: the large generation of Green House Gases (GHG) from 
human activity, which covers the earth's atmosphere, traps solar energy in the earth, and increases the earth's temperature.

4. How can we curb climate change?
Answer : 

Save energy at home:

Most of our electricity and heat is generated from coal, oil and gas. Use less 
energy by minimizing the need for heating and cooling temperatures, switching to LED light bulbs and 
energy-saving electrical appliances, washing your clothes in cold water, or hanging laundry to dry 
Instead of using a dryer.

Walk, cycle, or take public transportation:

The highways are filled with vehicles, the majority of which use diesel or petrol. 
Walking or cycling instead of using a motor vehicle will reduce greenhouse gas emissions â€” while improving your health and fitness. 
For longer distances, consider taking the train or bus. Also, whenever possible, try sharing a ride.


Eat more vegetables:

Eating more vegetables, fruit, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, and less meat and dairy, 
significantly lowering your environmental impact. Producing plant-based foods generally results in fewer gas emissions 
greenhouse and requires less energy, land, and water.
